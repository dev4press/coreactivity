Monitor and log all kinds of activity happening on the WordPress website, with fine control over events to log, detailed log and events panels...

== Description ==
CoreActivity is a free plugin for monitoring and logging various activities of the WordPress powered website. The plugin is highly modular, with events registered and controlled by multiple Components.

= Geo Location of IPs =
The plugin can locate where the IP making the request is coming from. There are currently three methods available, with more coming in the future:

* Online via GeoJS.io website
* IP2Location Local Database
* MaxMind GeoLite2 Local Database

To use IP2Location, you need to have an account on IP2Location, to get the download token, and getting the Lite versions of the database is free. To use MaxMind GeoLite2, you need to have MaxMind account, and the license for downloading the files, it is free for the GeoLite2 database files. Plugin supports use of all Lite databases for both providers, and using the provided token it can keep the database updated on a weekly basis.

== Installation ==
= General Requirements =
* PHP: 7.4 or newer

= PHP Notice =
* Plugin doesn't work with PHP 7.3 or older versions.

= WordPress Requirements =
* WordPress: 5.9 or newer

= WordPress Notice =
* Plugin may work with WordPress 5.8 or older versions, but there is no guarantee of that, and plugin is no longer tested with these WordPress versions.

= Basic Installation =
* Plugin folder in the WordPress plugins should be `coreactivity`.
* Upload `coreactivity` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
* Plugin adds a new top level menu called 'CoreActivity' inside Tools.
* Check all the plugin settings before using the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I configure the plugin? =
Open the newly added top level `CoreActivity` panel, and there you will find the 'Settings' page.

= How is the events detection working? =
Plugin uses a system of filters and actions in WordPress (and supported plugins) to hook and process information and log events based on that. If the changes to the website are done by direct database manipulation via queries or custom functions that don't use established procedures, plugin can't detect such events.

= How are the log entries stored? =
Plugin creates three new database tables where all events are registered, and all the events logged.

= How much the logging process slows down the website? =
If you have all events enabled, the plugin will add 150+ hooks into various elements of WordPress and plugins. That is not too much when compared to 3000+ hooks WordPress runs on average, so it will not have a big impact on WordPress performance. And, it is a good idea to disable events you don't need to use.

= Will coreActivity work if the cache plugin is used? =
Yes. But since cache plugins are bypassing WordPress to serve cached response, some events will be affected when the cached response is returned. To learn more, check out this article: [CoreActivity and Cache Plugins](https://www.dev4press.com/kb/article/coreactivity-cache-plugins/).

= How precise is GEO Location? =
If the database for GEO location is regularly updated, locating the IP to the country is most likely close to 100% precise. When it comes to more detailed location within the country, that is not always precise, and it depends on the country.
