				<h3>Share and Link</h3>
				<p>
					Easy way for your visitors to share content on popular social networks, with the built-in tracking of shares and a lot of customization options.
				</p>
				<p>
					Share block can be added automatically, or you can use block (as well as block in the sidebar), shortcode or function. You can have share for posts and terms archives, or any custom URL on the website, and you can also include Like button along the share buttons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Share block can be added as a Floating element site wide, positioned on left or right side of the screen.

				<h3>Blocks</h3>
				<p>
					Use blocks in the block editor or with Full Site Editing themes to add social network profiles and inline share buttons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both blocks include a lot of settings to select the networks, control colors, display layout, size and many other things to make the blocks look the way you need them. Using the alignment option, you can reshape the way the buttons are displayed. And, as expected, blocks are completely responsive.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can add both blocks more than once, with different settings and different included networks and buttons.
